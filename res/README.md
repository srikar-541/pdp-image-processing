##Assignment 7: An image processing application.

##Introduction

Many applications use color images. A good number of these provide a way to change their appearance in different ways. For example, Instagram has “filters” that convert a picture into something more interesting. They do this by editing the colors of individual dots in the image (called pixels).

This program provides functionalities to generate new images, filter existing images and perform color transformations on existing images.
At this time,
It can perform sepia and grayscale color transformations.
It can apply blur and sharpen filters.
It can generate images for the National flags of Greece,France and Switzerland.
It can also generate images of stripes of vertical or horizontal rainbows and a checkerboard of user defined sizes.
